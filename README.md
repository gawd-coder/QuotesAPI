# QuotesAPI
**KOSS** Task 01  :: A **CLI** that accepts data from user and presents Quotes using **Quotes API**
## Requirements
Install **Click** and **requests** using **pip**
## Technologies
### Command Line Parsing Library
I chose **Click** as the parsing library as I had searched about it after seeing it being used in Task 2.1 of ARK Software team which made a **CLI TIC-TAC-TOE** game (https://github.com/archit120/gym-tictactoe/blob/master/examples/minimax_agent.py - automatic!). I found Click to be easy to implement. Quotes API task required to print the quotes according to choice filled by user on the CLI so Click fitted in perfectly for this.
### Python Requests Library
I used the **requests** library of Python as it is very easy to use and it was sufficient to complete this task
### Approach
Firstly, **Back End Development** was a new thing for me so I read a few articles on how to use web API in your program. From there I decided that I would be using the above mentioned technologies+**Virtual Environment**+I also made a **Setup File**. Later on after getting properly acquanited with the working of these technologies I realised that I require only a script file along with the installed libraries to complete this task. So I restarted and successfully completed the task.
